# Week 4, Day 3: Homework
## Python Data Structures: Stacks & Queues and Linked Lists

#### Exercise 1 - Adding Elements to LinkedList:
- Start by creating a new method in our LinkedList class called "add_list_elements".
- This method should take in a list as an argument.
- Loop through each element in the list and convert it to a node.
- Add each node to the end of the linked list using the "add_node" method we already have in the class.
